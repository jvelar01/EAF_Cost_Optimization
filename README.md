 Exploring Optimization Possibilities for Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)

This project explores various possibilities for optimizing the performance of an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), focusing on two main aspects: temperature optimization based on energy usage and electricity consumption optimization. The goal is to enhance efficiency and reduce energy consumption in the EAF process, which is crucial for the steel-making industry.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Temperature Optimization**: Predict and optimize the temperature within the furnace based on energy consumption.
- **Electricity Consumption Optimization**: Analyze and optimize electricity usage during the EAF process to improve energy efficiency.

By using regression techniques, we aim to understand the factors that impact temperature and electricity consumption, thus enabling better control and more efficient operation of the furnace.

## Methodology

- **Regression Techniques**: Various regression algorithms were applied to predict temperature and electricity consumption based on a variety of parameters.
- **Key Parameters**:
  - **Gas Flow**: The rate at which gas flows in the furnace, influencing temperature and energy efficiency.
  - **Transformer Data**: Data related to the furnace transformer, which helps in understanding energy distribution.
  - **Weight of Material Charged**: The amount of material introduced into the furnace, affecting both energy needs and temperature management.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data was cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy and suitability for regression modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle - Industrial Data from the Arc Furnace](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuriykatser/industrial-data-from-the-arc-furnace), which contains detailed information about the furnaceâ€™s energy usage, temperature, gas flow, and transformer data, among other variables.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into the optimization of the EAF process, particularly in relation to temperature control and electricity consumption. By leveraging regression techniques and understanding the role of key parameters such as gas flow, transformer data, and material weight, this project aims to contribute to more energy-efficient and cost-effective steel production.
